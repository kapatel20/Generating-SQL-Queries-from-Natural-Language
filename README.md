# Natural Language to SQL Query Generation

## Abstract

Relational databases store a significant portion of the world's data, but accessing this data often requires users to be proficient in query languages like SQL. This project focuses on the generation of executable SQL queries from natural language questions using state-of-the-art models. The primary models explored are proposed by Zhong et al. (2017) for SELECT column, WHERE clause, and Aggregator functions, Ikshu and Archit (2018) for Aggregator functions, and Xu et al. (2017) for SELECT and WHERE clauses.
